# 🐍 Learning Git with Python 

![🚦 Workflow Status](https://github.com/Polinez/GroupLearningGit/actions/workflows/testyCI.yml/badge.svg)

This project was created during my university class, where I learned Git and other DevOps tools.

## 📚 What I've Learned 

### 🧰 Git 
The first task was to create a simple Python app to check students' attendance and save it in a `.txt` file.  
We worked in teams of four to learn how to:
- 🗂️ Create a GitHub repository,  
- 🤝 Collaborate using pull requests, and  
- 🛠️ Manage team workflows effectively.

### ✅ Unit Tests 
For this task, we worked individually. We wrote unit tests for our previous code using `pytest`, which helped us understand the importance of testing in software development.

### ⚙️ CI/CD 
In this task, I learned how to use GitHub Actions to automate various processes, including:
- 🚀 Running unit tests with coverage on pull requests,  
- ✨ Using **Super-Linter** to enforce clean and consistent code,  
- 🔄 Automating Python code formatting with `ruff` and committing corrections, and  
- 📋 Automatically converting TODO comments into issues in the GitHub Issues tab.

Feel free to explore the repository and see the progress I've made!
I know this could have been done with fewer commits, but some parts of the learning process required a bit of trial and error. 😉
